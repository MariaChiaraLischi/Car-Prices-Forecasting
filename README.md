# Data Analysis for Business Project 2

This project was completed as part of the coursework for the course Data Analysis for Business during the Bachelorâ€™s degree program in Management and Computer Science at Luiss Guido Carli University.

This project examines an automobile dataset through data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling of car prices, followed by clustering to categorize car types based on their attributes.

The dataset contains information about automobiles: each of the 205 observations represents a different car model, with details about its features and price.

The script is useful to:
- prepare the dataset for subsequent analysis by cleaning it and encoding categorical values;
- conduct an explanatory data analysis to understand variables and their correlations;
- build and compare multiple predictive models for cars' prices based on their characteristics;
- apply, visualize and compare many clusterizations of car types based on selected covariates.
